# Data-Engineering
We will be developing a data pipiline for the unstructured and messy data that has been provided to produce a structured SQL database, and automate 
the data updates and generate efficient and meaningful automated reports. The data provided will be from the US Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) about hospitals functioning in the country. The data includes over a hundred variables, we will be focusing at roughly thirty
variables for our database and analysis through automated reports.
